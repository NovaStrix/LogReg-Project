# LogReg-Project

This notebook is for learning purposes

The project is making a classification model which predicts the likeliness of someone adopting a program.

We will be using Logistic Regression with cleaned and feature-engineered data.

The end goal is to make a summary based on the provided format.

I will also put my findings into a [report](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dXClGP3vrzPI_cswL9WswarFeUpZ9G7kNgCI-cvShsQ/edit?usp=sharing)

I also did a little bit of Simple Neural Network below just to compare.

Enjoy!
